# Balance-Pal
An Arduino based system in order to test and people's balance.
This system contains an Arduino board (MTKã€€linkit), MPU6050, WIFI kit.
In order to test the user's balance, the user will be asked to stand on single foot, with this system being set on his knee.
The system will keep recording the accelerometer's(MPU6050) data and send to the MCS cloud database with WIFI kit.
We also develop an Android app which downloads the sensor data from the MCS and analyzes it with the embedded algorithm.
Eventually, the user will get rated about his balance by the app. 

* Only the Arduino code is provided here but not the app's code.
